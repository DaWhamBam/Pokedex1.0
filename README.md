## Pokedex 1.0
Hallo,

**Short description of the project**  
This app is my first ever that I built myself from the beginning. As part of my training to become an
App Developer, all students have to build their own app to complete the module.
My result of the 2 month project time can be found here. It was worked on for about 2 hours a day.

The basic requirement to pass the module was to build a RecyclerVIew, a Navigation, and an Api Call.
A storage in a database was the last point.
As a bonus I decided to add a search, a filtering and a fight.

**Description**  
My idea was to develop a Pokedex and thus bring known knowledge and discoverable information into an app.
Due to the very good API that exists for this, it was possible for me to implement a lot of what I had
planned in advance. For example, a rudimentary Pokemon battle. With the understanding of the API also
came the ideas, what is still possible to integrate into the app.

Since the project was done as part of my thesis, this will be the end of the development for now.
Maybe I will come back at a later time to bring the app to 2.0.
